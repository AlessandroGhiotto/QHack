    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " You must complete the `linear_combination` function to build the above circuit that implements the linear combination\n",
    " \n",
    " $$ \n",
    " \\alpha U + \\beta V\n",
    " $$ \n",
    " \n",
    " of two single-qubit unitaries U and V, and returns the probabilities on the auxiliary register. For simplicity, we take $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ to be positive real numbers.\n",
    " \n",
    " As a helper function, you are also asked to complete the `W` function, which returns the unitary $W(\\alpha,\\beta).$\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Input\n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `U` (`list(list(float))`): A $2\\times 2$ matrix representing the single-qubit unitary operator $U$.\n",
    " - `V` (`list(list(float))`): A $2\\times 2$ matrix representing the single-qubit unitary operator $V$\n",
    " - `alpha` (`float`): The prefactor $\\alpha$ of $U$ in the linear combination, as above.\n",
    " - `beta` (`float`): The prefactor $\\beta$ of $V$ in the linear combination, as above.\n",
    "  \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " The output used to test your solution is a `float` corresponding to the probability of measuring $\\vert 0 \\rangle$ on the main register. This is the first element of your output of `linear_combination`. We will extract this element for you in our testing functions!\n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's an absolute tolerance of `0.001`), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " Good luck!\n",
