# QHack2023 coding challenges

Solutions to the QHack 2023 coding challenges here!

## Organization of this repo

The challenges are organized into 5 categories or _stories_:

1. Tutorial challenges
2. A tale of timbits
3. Bending Bennett's Laws
4. Fall of Sqynet
5. Office Hijinks

Within each of the folders corresponding to the stories above, you will find a number of subfolders, one for each challenge in that story. Inside each of these folders, you will find a README file containing the challenge statement, a Jupyter Notebook containing the template for solving the challenge, and (sometimes) a folder with images.

## Credits and Acknowledgments

The solutions to this challenge were referenced from videos by [Diego Emilio Serrano](https://www.youtube.com/@diemilio). Many thanks for your clear and helpful explanations.
